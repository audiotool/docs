# Splitter

The Splitter is a tool which allows for one audio signal to be split
into 3 separate audio signals. A device's output can be plugged into the
input on the left side of the Splitter and then a maximum of three
separate but identical audio signals can be routed from the outputs
labelled A, B and C on the right side of the Splitter.
