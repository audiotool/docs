Matrix (Draft)
==============

The Matrix is a classic arpeggiator that takes chords and splits them
into single notes. There are a bunch of modes and parameters to tell the
Matrix how the notes should be played. A step sequencer's pattern allows
you to mute or tie or even release the full chord on certain steps. The
Matrix has its own note-track and must be connected to any note-input of
a synthesiser. The Matrix is still in development. Any suggestions are
welcome.
