# Centroid

The Centroid is a 16-track studio mixer. Each of the 16 channels have
the same functionality, each channel includes a semi-parametric
equaliser, panning and gain controls. The centroid also includes 2
auxiliary send/return inputs, this makes it possible for 2 different
effect chains to be inputed through the device. Each channel has a set
of controls which can be used to determine how much the signal from each
channel is affected by the inputed effects. The Centroid is a very tough
machine that will still work even if you stand on it.

###### Channel Controls

This is where each inputed channel can be adjusted individually. All of
the 16 channels include exactly the same parameters, for this reason the
below image only labels the parameters of Channel 3.

**NOTE:** *The below image only shows the controls found on channel 3
although all channel parameters work the same way for each channel.*

1.  **gain** - Control over the channels input gain.
2.  **high** - Allows controls over the inputed signals high
    frequencies.
3.  **freq** - This control is specific to the mid control, this control
    allows definition of how much of the signal is affected by the mid
    control.
4.  **mid** - Allows control over the mid level of the inputed signal.
5.  **low** - Control over the signals low frequencies.
6.  **aux 1** - Control over how much the signal is affected by whatever
    effects are being utilised through aux 1.
7.  **aux 2** - Control over how much the signal from the channel is
    affected by whatever effects are inputed through aux 2.
8.  **pre** - Pre stands for pre-fader. This control is related to aux 1
    and 2, this allows you to decide whether the inputed signal goes
    through aux 1 or 2 before going through the channels level fader. If
    pre is urned on this means that the signal will go through the level
    fader first.
9.  **pan** - Individual panning for each channel.
10. **level fader** - Control over the volume of the inputed audio
    signal.
11. **mute** - Allows you to mute each channel individually.
12. **solo** - Exact opposite of mute, mutes all other channels apart
    from the channel where solo is selected. Solo allows for each
    channel to be played back individually without hearing any of the
    other channels.
13. **input** - Each channel's input is located at the top of the
    channel. One device or a whole chain of devices can be plugged into
    each channel's input.

###### Master Controls

The master controls are similar to the master controls of any other
device, they control the device master output and allow for adjustments
to be made to the output signal rather than each channel individually.
The master controls also include the master controls and inputs for both
aux 1 and 2.

**NOTE:** *The below image only shows the controls for aux 1 since the
controls for aux 1 and 2 are exactly the same.*

1.  **output** - This is the Centroid's master output, this is where all
    of the channels are merged together into one cable.
2.  **aux level** - Allows adjustment over how much of the effect chain
    inputed into aux 1 will be allowed into the device.
3.  **send** - This is aux 1's input, this is where an effect chain's
    input can be inputed to aux 1.
4.  **return** - This is where an effect chains output can be inputed to
    aux 1.
5.  **pan** - Master panning control, this will affect the signal from
    all channels.
6.  **level** - Centroids master volume control, this will affect the
    volume of every channel.

###### Aux

The Centroid includes 2 auxiliary modules. These each allow for an
effect or a chain of effects to be inputed into the device, an effect
pedals input can be plugged into send and the effect pedal output can be
plugged into the return input. This makes it possible to add the effect
to all, some or just one of the Centroid's channels. It is then possible
to adjust how much the effect or chain of effects will affect each
channel individually. As well as the individual controls for aux 1 and 2
found in each channel aux 1 and 2 also have master level controls which
are labelled on the above image.

**Below:** *The below image shows a Reverb effect pedal utilising
send/return with aux 1.*
