# Kobolt

The Kobolt is a 16-channel mixer, with each channel having its own
volume and panning controls. A single Kobolt mixer could be used in your
track to input all of your devices or many could be used. You could
apply effects to your devices before they are plugged into the Kobolt or
an effect could be applied to the kobolt itself, meaning that any device
plugged into the Kobolt would go through the effect pedal and have the
effect applied to it. If you would be using a Kobolt as your main mixer
its output would be plugged into the input for the master output.
