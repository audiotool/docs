# Merger

The Merger is a tool which allows for 3 inputs to be merged into 1
output. The functionality of the Merger is the exact opposite of that of
the Splitter. A maximum of 3 different audio signals can be plugged into
the inputs labelled A, B and C on the left side of the Merger and then 1
audio signal can be routed from the output on the right side of the
Merger.
