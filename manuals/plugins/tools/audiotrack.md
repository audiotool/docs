# Audiotrack

An audiotrack is a single channel device which allows you to add a
library sample to your track. When you drag an audiotrack device to the
desktop, a corresponding audio track is automatically created in the
timeline. You can then drag a sample from the sample browser into the
audiotrack's corresponding audio track in the timeline. NOTE: It is
possible to drag a loop straight from the sample browser to the desktop.
An Audiotrack will then be automatically created and the sample added to
the timeline.
