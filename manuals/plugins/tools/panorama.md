# Panorama

This utility device can manipulate the stereo panorama. Each stereo
channel can be moved to new locations in the balance field. The factor
parameter allows multiplication of each channel ranging from -1 to +1.
-1 will invert the phase. This can be used to cancel out sounds in the
middle.
