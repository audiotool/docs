# Minimixer

The Minimixer is a 4 channel mixer similar to the Kobolt. What makes the
Minimixer different to the Kobolt is that the Minimixer has an AUX or
send/return feature. The AUX feature allows for an effect to be routed
out off and then back into the Minimixer, this makes it possible for
effects to be applied through all of the mixers channels without having
to apply effects separately through each channel individually. Upon
doing this it is possible to control how much each channel is affected
by the inputed effect or effects with each channels individual AUX
controls.
