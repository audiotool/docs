Audio Track
===========

The *Audio Track device* is the device that can be used to add and arrange
audio files on the timeline. You can add an audio track by dragging
the *Audio Track* devices from the device list onto the desktop.

Each *Audio Track device* has one or multiple audio tracks associated with them
on the timeline.

There are different ways to place audio on an audio track. You can either :ref:`browse
existing samples <The sample browser>` and select one for your project, :ref:`upload your own samples <Uploading your own sample>`,
or :ref:`record a sample live <Live recording a new sample>`.
