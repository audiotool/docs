Audio Track
===========

The Audio Track device is the device that can be used to add and arrange
audio files on the timeline. You can add an audio track by dragging
the Audio Track devices from the device list onto the desktop.

Each Audio Track device has one or multiple audio tracks associated with them
on the timeline.
