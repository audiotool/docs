# Bandsplitter

The Bandsplitter works similar to the Splitter but separates the
spectrum into three frequency bands. The cutoffs can be adjusted and a
gain can be applied to each output. For example you can apply a reverb
only to the high frequencies of a signal and merge them in the mixer of
your choice.
