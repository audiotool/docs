# Autofilter

The autofilter is a filter that can have its cut-off frequency altered
either by the inputed signal or by its side-chain input (if used).

1.  **attack** - How fast the filter movement will reach its maximum
    depth.
2.  **release** - How fast the filter will move back to its initial
    frequency (see frequency).
3.  **hold** - Sets the duration the filter will stay at its maximum
    depth.
4.  **gain** - Boosts the gain of the signal.
5.  **filter mode** - The filter has 4 Modes: lowpass, lowpass inverted,
    hipass and hipass inverted.
6.  **frequency** - This parameter allows control over the filter's
    cut-off frequency.
7.  **resonance** - Allows control over the filter's resonance. NOTE:
    Don't turn it up too much, possible damage to your ears and mind.
8.  **depth** - Depth and direction of the filter movement.
9.  **threshold** - The threshold sets the filter's sensitivity, when
    will the the filter movement start.
10. **dry/wet** - The dry/wet parameter lets you blend between the
    original (dry) and the filtered signal (wet). Turning the dry/wet to
    0% will mean that the signal will pass through the device unchanged.
11. **side-chain** - If a second signal is inputed into the autofilter's
    side-chain then the filter will react on the side-chain input
    instead of the main input signal.
