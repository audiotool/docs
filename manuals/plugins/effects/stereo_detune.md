# Stereo Detune

The stereo detune effect pedal allows for the two stereo channels to be
off-set against the other. This is done by controlling how much one of
the channels is delayed compared to the other. The Stereo Detune effect
pedal can be used to enhance the sound by pitching the sound into stereo
panorama. Works especially well with voices or synth pads to give the
sound a richer feel.

  - **tune** - Allows adjustment of the tuning.
  - **delay** - Allows for adjustment of the delay of one of the
    channels. (the delay is applied to the channel that is not de-tuned,
    for example if the left channel is de-tuned then the right channel
    will be delayed)
