Gate Effect
===========

The Gate effect pedal can be used to mute out unwanted sounds from the
inputted audio signal by gating out sounds under a given threshold. The
Gate pedal also has a side-chain input, this allows for the signal from
another device to be used to trigger the gate. For example, if a synth
is inputted into the Gate and then a drum machine is side-chained through
the Gate, the Gate will only become active when the drum machine makes a
sound.

-  **gate** - Sets the threshold of the effect, any frequencies under
   the gate will be muted.
-  **hold** - Allows definition of the amount of time the Gate will stay
   open after the signal falls below the given threshold.
-  **attack** - Sets the amount of time for the Gate to change from open
   to closed, can give the effect of the sound fading in.
-  **release** - Sets the amount of time the Gate takes to go from
   closed to open. A fast release will abruptly cut of the sound once it
   has fallen below the given threshold, a slower release will smoothly
   change from closed to open much like a slow fade out.
-  **gain** - Output volume.
