# Exciter

The exciter adds brightness to the input signal. The exciter does this
by splitting the input signal into two bands and then by adding slight
amounts of distortion to the higher frequencies before merging the two
bands back together again.

1.  **tone** - Where in the frequency range the excitement will begin.
2.  **Power** - How much of the input signal will be excited.
3.  **dry/wet** - The balance between the excited signal and the
    non-excited signal.
