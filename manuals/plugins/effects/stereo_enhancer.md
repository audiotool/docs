# Stereo Enhancer

The Stereo Enhancer changes the stereo image of the input signal. This
device allows you to blend the signal from mono to an increased stereo
spread. This device works by splitting the frequency band of the inputed
signal and then delaying the higher frequencies before merging the
signals back together.

1.  **invert** - Inverts the delay of the stereo channels.
2.  **tone** - Specifies the cut-off frequency above which the stereo
    processing will begin.
3.  **mono/stereo** - The first range of this parameter (0 - 50%) can be
    used to merge the left and the right channels into mono. The second
    half of the parameter's range (between 50% - 100%) will spread the
    stereo.

**TIPS\!:**

  - It is important to remember that not everybody will be listening to
    your track on stereo headphones, therefore it is important to test
    your track on speakers as well as listening to it from a distance.
  - One problem that could be encountered is that if the stereo spread
    is too large, sounds with higher frequencies (like hihats) will
    sound doubled. This can be combated by decreasing the stereo spread.
  - If the stereo spread is too low then flanging may occur at the
    transition band between the high and the low frequencies. This can
    be mediated by either modifying the cut-off frequency or by slightly
    increasing the stereo spread.
  - When working with higher frequencies (like hihats) a sensible
    setting for the Mono/Stereo parameter is between 60% and 70%. Once
    an optimal stereo spread is achieved the tone can be adjusted so
    that the transition band falls below the higher frequencies but
    above the body of the track.
