# Rasselbock

The Rasselbock is in essence a re-sampler with 7 built-in effects. What
makes the Rasselbock different is that has 5 separate channel outputs
(not including the master output). This makes it possible to route
effect pedals through the device and trigger them in real-time by
drawing blocks onto the sequencing grid. You can decide how big the
blocks are before you add them to the sequencing grid by toggling
through the different snapping options. The Rasselbock has a multitude
of features and can be used in many different ways in your Audiotool
arrangements. The Rasselbock can be used subtly to simply pitch down one
specific sound or instrument, to reverse a sound, or to add a scratch
but The Rasselbock could also be used to completely change a sound or to
totally change the structure of your track depending on where in your
processing chain you use it.

###### Pattern Options

Like the drum machines and other devices which include internal
sequencers The Rasselbock has 4 pattern banks A, B, C and D with each
pattern containing 8 possible patterns and an edit range of 64 steps.

1.  **length** - Displays the length of your sequence.
2.  **length +/-** - Allow for the length of your sequence to be
    increased or decreased. TIP\! Holding down SHIFT while selecting
    these buttons will allow you to double of half the number of steps
    in your sequence, from 2-4, from 16-32 etc.etc.)
3.  **edit range** - The sequencer contains 16 step buttons but the
    Tr808 allows for sequences up to 64 steps long. This control
    allows for you to use the same 16 buttons to edit a 64 step sequence
    by reusing the same step buttons to edit different parts of the
    sequence.
4.  **snapping grid** - The snapping options allow definition of the
    size of the blocks that will be drawn on the sequence grid. NOTE:
    When drawing blocks on the sequence grid it is possible to hold the
    mouse down and drag smaller blocks to make them bigger.
5.  **pattern** - Allows for toggling through the device's internal
    patterns within the selected pattern bank.
6.  **pattern bank** - Allows for toggling through the device's
    different pattern banks (A, B, C and D)
7.  **clear** - Deletes the currently selected pattern.

###### Outputs

The 5 individual outputs across the top of the Rasselbock are triggered
or opened only when a block has been drawn onto that output's channel in
the grid, for example, if there is a block drawn onto outputs 1 and 2
then the signal from the Rasselbock will be outputed through outputs 1
and 2 (as well as the master output if plugged in) but not through
outputs 3, 4 and 5. This makes it possible for you decide exactly when
your arrangement will be diverted through the 5 separate outputs. They
could all be triggered at the same time or individually. This is useful
if you only want part of the arrangement to be processed by an effect or
by a chain of effects. All of the outputs have a set of controls to the
right of the grid as well as mute and solo buttons for each channel.

1.  **channel list** - Lists the output channels.
2.  **sequencing grid** - Open the output channels by drawing blocks
    onto the grid.
3.  **level** - Output volume (individual to each channel).
4.  **balance** - Panning control, left speaker/right speaker
    (individual to each channel).
5.  **dry/wet** - The wet/dry control allows adjustment of how much of
    the signal going through one of the individual outputs is mixed with
    the signal going through the built-in effects. Dry being that the
    signal is not mixed with the signal going through the built-in
    effects and full wet meaning that the 2 signals are mixed 50/50
    (individual to each channel).
6.  **mix/energy** - Mix and energy are the 2 possible modes for each
    channels dry/wet parameters. Mix will mix the 2 signals without
    making any adjustments giving the signal a higher amplitude. Energy
    will bring both signals down in amplitude so that when they are
    mixed there is not a drastic jump in the amplitude of the output
    signal (individual to each channel).
7.  **mute** - Mutes the corresponding output channel.
8.  **solo** - Plays the corresponding channel alone, while muting the
    other output channels.

## Built-in Effects

The 7 built-in effects can be added to the sequence by drawing blocks
onto the sequence grid in the same way you would trigger the output
channels. What is different with the built-in effects is that the
effects can be dragged to new positions in the list. The highest effect
in the list is the effect that is being applied to the signal first and
the second effect will be applied second and so on. All of the effects
except for the shuffle and reverse have their own set of parameter
controls. All of these features together make the Rasselbock an
extremely powerful device since there is a multitude of different effect
combinations that can be assembled. Like the output channels each effect
has a mute and solo button for muting that effect or for playing it
alone.

1.  **sequencing grid** - Blocks can be drawn into the sequencing grid.
    Drawing blocks in the sequencing grid will activate the
    corresponding effect at whatever position the block or blocks are
    drawn into the grid.
2.  **effect parameters** - Each effect has its own set of parameter
    controls specific to that effect.
3.  **mute** - Mutes the corresponding effect.
4.  **solo** - Plays the effect alone while muting the other effects.
5.  **Shuffle** - The shuffle effect does not work in the same way as
    the shuffle function on the drum machines or other device that
    include internal patterns. The Rasselbock shuffle effect will
    randomise the signal, although this is not completely random since
    adding the same sized block to the same position on the grid will
    create the same effect.
6.  **Speed** - The Speed effect allows for the speed of the sample or
    instrument to be lowered by lowering the signal's pitch.
7.  **Stop** - Stop will stop the sample or instrument.
8.  **Gate** - The Gate effect mimics the effect of the Gate effect
    pedal only that the Rasselbock's gate is automatically synced to the
    rhythm of the sample or instrument which is inputed.
9.  **Stutter** - The Stutter effect works by taking whatever sound is
    at the start of the block and repeating it until the end of the
    block.
10. **Scratch** - The Scratch effect simulates a turntable style
    scratch. Like the other built-in effects the length of the Scratch
    effect is determined by the length of the block drawn onto the
    sequencing grid.
11. **Reverse** - The Reverse effect will simply reverse the sound,
    although only the last half of the block will be reversed. Only the
    send half of the block will be reversed because the Rasselbock needs
    the first half of the block to record the sound into its internal
    buffer before playing it back again in reverse.
