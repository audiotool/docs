# Crusher

The Crusher or Bit Crusher effect pedal produces distortion by reducing
the resolution of the audio signal, in a similar way to the Tube effect
pedal. The Crusher can be used conservatively to add warmth to the
original waveform or can cranked to produce heavy distortion, although
quality will be compromised. The Crusher is considered an essential
effect for producers making harder-edged, industrial dance music.

  - **pre-gain** - Allows for adjustment of the volume of the signal
    before it is processed.
  - **post-gain** - Allows control over the volume of the signal once it
    has been processed.
  - **bits** - Bit depth of the signal.
  - **rate** - Sample rate of the signal.
  - **mix** - Controls how much of the processed signal is mixed with
    the original, unprocessed signal.
