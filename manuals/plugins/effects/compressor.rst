Compressor
==========

The Compressor effect pedal allows for reduction of the dynamic range of
the inputted audio signal by narrowing the difference between the high
and low levels of volume (amplitude). Compression can be used to make
your music sound louder without increasing its peak amplitude. It can be
used to make quieter sounds louder while leaving louder sounds
unchanged.

-  **threshold** - The level above which the signal is reduced.
-  **ratio** - Determines the input/output ratio for frequencies above
   the given threshold.
-  **attack** - The attack phase is the period when the compressor is
   decreasing gain to reach the level determined by the ratio, once the
   level has fallen below the given threshold.
-  **release** - The release determines the length of time the
   compressor is increasing gain to the level determined by the ratio,
   once the level has fallen below the given threshold.
-  **gain** - Output volume.
-  **peak/RMS** - When set to peak the compressor responds to
   instantaneous changes to the level of the input signal, providing
   tighter peak control (more hardcore). Using the RMS setting will mean
   that the compressor will apply an averaging function to the input
   signal before its level has been compared to the threshold, allowing
   for more relaxed compression.
