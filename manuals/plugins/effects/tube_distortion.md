# Tube Distortion

The Tube Distortion effect pedal compresses or clips the audio signal
adding sustain and overtones, giving a richer sound. The Tube can be
cranked to achieve mega loud dirty industrial hardcore grunge or can be
used more conservatively by adding subtle overdrive, giving warmth and
thickness to the original signal.

  - **drive** - Allows adjustment of the how much distortion is applied
    to the original signal.
  - **blend** - Changes the character of the distortion.
  - **gain** - Output volume.
