# Phaser

The phaser effect pedal is a modulation effect that works by creating a
series of peaks and troughs in the frequency spectrum. The position of
the peaks and troughs are modulated so that they vary over time creating
a sweeping effect. The Phaser effect pedal can be used to give natural
sounds a synthesised feel, for example making a human voice sound like
the voice of a robot.

  - **frequency min/max** - Allow for a frequency range to be set for
    the effect. Only frequencies between the min and max will be
    affected.
  - **feedback** - Defines how much of the processed signal is feed back
    into the effect.
  - **speed (LFO)** - Allows adjustment of the speed of the phasing
    effect.
  - **depth (LFO)** - In the case of the Phaser the depth controls the
    mix, how much of the processed signal is mixed with the original,
    unprocessed signal.
