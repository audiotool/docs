# Reverb

The Reverb effect pedal simulates the effect of reverberation in an
enclosed space. The Reverb pedal uses multiple delay circuits to
simulate the effect of reverberation.

  - **room size** - Determines the size of the virtual enclosed space.
  - **pre-delay** - Determines the length of time it takes for the echo
    to come back. (The length of the gap between the echos)
  - **feedback** - Allows adjustment of how much of the processed signal
    is fed back into the effect.
  - **damp** - Control over the level of the devices low-pass filter.
    Low frequencies are passed while high frequencies are filtered out.
  - **level** - Output volume.
