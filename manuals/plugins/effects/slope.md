# Slope

The Slope effect pedal is a filter with 4 different modes, Lowpass,
highpass, notch and bandpass.

  - **highpass** - Passes the signals high frequencies while attenuating
    (reducing the amplitude of) frequencies lower than the given cut-off
    frequency.
  - **lowpass** - Passes the signals low frequencies while attenuating
    frequencies higher than the given cutt-off frequency.
  - **notch** - Passes most frequencies unattenuated but attenuates
    frequencies in a specified range at low levels.
  - **bandpass** - Passes frequencies within a specified range and
    attenuates frequencies outside of that range.
