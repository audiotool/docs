# Flanger

The Flanger effect pedal works by taking the audio signal and mixing it
with a delayed, pitch modulated copy of itself. The Flanger is similar
to the Chorus effect pedal and can be used to give sounds a sweeping
effect.

  - **delay** - Allows control of the Flanger's short delay.
  - **feedback** - Allows control over how much of the processed signal
    is feed back into the effect.
  - **speed(LFO)** - Allows adjustment of the speed of the phasing
    effect.
  - **depth(LFO)** - Increases the amplitude of the LFO.
