# Parametric Equaliser

The Parametric Equaliser allows for control over the amplitude and
centre frequency of a specific frequency range. Parametric equalisation
might be used for a number of reasons, tonal enhancement (enhancement of
a certain frequency range), to remove excess resonance, noise reduction
or to combat unwanted sounds.

  - **frequency** - Allows for definition of the effects centre
    frequency.
  - **gain** - Allows adjustment of the amplitude within the specified
    frequency range.
  - **bandwidth** - Allows definition of the width of the frequency
    range.
