# Delay

The Delay effect pedal gives the effect of a repeating, decaying echo.
The Delay effect pedal works by sampling the input signal and storing it
in a buffer. The stored audio sample can then be played back, adhering
to the parameters set with the effects controls.

  - **steps** - Allows control over how many steps before the delay
    starts after the original signal is played.
  - **length** - Allows adjustment of the length of the Delay in
    relation to the BPM or time scale of the song. (steps multiplied by
    length equals the duration of the delay)
  - **feedback** - Allows control over how much of the processed signal
    is fed back through the device.
  - **level** - The Level is the volume of the processed delay signal in
    relation to the unprocessed, original signal.
