# Gate Effect

The Gate effect pedal can be used to mute out unwanted sounds from the
inputed audio signal by gating out sounds under a given threshold. The
Gate pedal also has a side-chain input, this allows for the signal from
another device to be used to trigger the gate. For example, if a synth
is inputed into the Gate and then a drum machine is side-chained through
the Gate, the Gate will only become active when the drum machine makes a
sound.

  - **gate** - Sets the threshold of the effect, any frequencies under
    the gate will be muted.
  - **hold** - Allows definition of the amount of time the Gate will
    stay open after the signal falls below the given threshold.
  - **attack** - Sets the amount of time for the Gate to change from
    open to closed, can give the effect of the sound fading in.
  - **release** - Sets the amount of time the Gate takes to go from
    closed to open. A fast release will abruptly cut of the sound once
    it has fallen below the given threshold, a slower release will
    smoothly change from closed to open much like a slow fade out.
  - **gain** - Output volume.
