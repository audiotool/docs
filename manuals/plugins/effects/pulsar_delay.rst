Pulsar Delay
============

The Pulsar Delay works much like the Delay but allows you low-pass the
feedback and switch channels on every feedback cycle. The delay time can
be adjusted in musical and absolute time for each stereo channel
separately. This can be used to create interesting stereo effects (ping
pong delay). The internal LFO can be applied to create flanger or chorus
effects as well.
