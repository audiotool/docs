# Graphical Equalizer

The graphical equalizer is a powerful device which can be used to boost
or suppress specific frequency ranges. The graphical equalizer consists
of 2 filters which can be controlled individually either by adjusting
the 2 sets of filter parameters on both sides of the device or by
adjusting each filters planet/satellites that are found on each side the
the graphical display. Each filter allows control over the gain, center
frequency, bandwidth and stereo spread. What makes a graphical EQ
special is that it is possible to draw exactly where you want each
filter to go on the devices display, with the frequency being displayed
horizontally and the gain being displayed vertically.

**Below:** The below image shows the 2 filter controls and their
planet/satellites. Everything that can be done with the filter's
parameters can be done by adjusting each filter's planet and satellites,
as well as this both filter's can be controlled at the same time by
using the global planet/satellites found in the center of the graphical
display.

The above image also shows the the devices master gain and dry/wet
controls. The gain controls the overall gain of the device and the
dry/wet controls how much the signal will be affected by the device. The
Graphical Equalizer dos not include a bypass button but if the dry/wet
control is turned to 0% the device will be bypassed and the signal will
go from the input to the output unchanged.

###### Controlling the filters

As already mentioned the exact same settings can be made by using either
the separate parameter controls for each filter or by using each
filter's corresponding planets/satellites. All of the planets and
satellites can be used to adjust the cut-off frequency of the filter(s)
as well as this each Planet and satellite are colour-coded (on rollover)
and correspond to one of the filter parameters. There are also a number
of shortcuts which can be used to change the behaviour of the planets.

**NOTE:** The below example only shows filter(A) working since both
filters controls work in exactly the same way.

1.  **gain** - The gain works on the vertical axis, the higher the gain
    the more that frequency range will be boosted. The gain has a range
    between -18dB and +18dB.
2.  **frequency** - The frequency parameter works on the horizontal axis
    with low frequencies being on the left of the display and the high
    frequencies on the right.
3.  **quality** - The quality refers to the bandwidth in which the
    filter will operate.
4.  **stereo** - The stereo parameter allows for the gain for the left
    and right channels to be offset.
5.  **filter(A) planet** - Dragging the filter's planet around the
    display allows for the gain and the frequency range to be adjusted.
    Holding <ctrl> (cmd for mac) while dragging the planet will make it
    so that the planet will be adjusting the quality and the cut-off
    frequency instead of the gain and the frequency. Holding <shift>
    while dragging the planet will make it so that the planet is
    controlling the frequency and the stereo spread.
6.  **filter(A) quality satellite** - Dragging the quality satellite
    around the display allows for the cut-off frequency and the quality
    to be adjusted.
7.  **filter(A) stereo satellite** - Dragging the stereo satellite
    allows for the cut-off frequency and the stereo spread to be
    adjusted.
