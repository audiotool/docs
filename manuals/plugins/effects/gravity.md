# Gravity

Gravity is a single-band compressor with visual feedback according to
its settings.

###### Parameter

  - Threshold - The level in decibel on which the device starts
    compressing
  - Ratio - The strength of the compressor
  - Knee - Softens the ratio beyond the threshold level
  - Attack - The speed the algorithm approaches the compressed level
  - Release - The speed the algorithm releases the compressed level when
    the input level is dropping below the threshold
  - Release **S**ync - Synchronises the release speed with the tempo
  - Analyse - Allows adjustment on the detection algorithm from peak
    (direct) to longer rms window sizes
  - Bypass - Bypasses the compression for comparison

###### Display

  - Orange meter - Displays the current gain reduction of the compressor
  - Blue curve - The actual compression curve
  - Blue meters - Shows the rms and peak value of the input and output
    signal
