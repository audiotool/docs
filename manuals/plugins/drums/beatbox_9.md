# Beatbox 9

The Beatbox 9 is very similar in functionality to the Beatbox 8 with the
instrument channels labelled across the top and the step sequencer along
the bottom. Making a drum sequence with the Beatbox 9 is also nearly
exactly the same as with the Beatbox 8, select which instrument you want
to use and add it to the sequence by clicking on the steps in the
sequence. Although similar to the Beatbox 8 the Beatbox 9 could be said
to sound more realistic since some of the instruments are sampled drum
hits as well as this the device has a much rounder and clearer overall
sound than the Beatbox 8.

###### Instrument Controls

The Beatbox 9 is sequenced by selecting the instrument you want to use
and then clicking on the sequencing button or buttons that correspond to
where you want to the hit to occour in the sequence. Only one instrument
can be added to the sequence at a time. Each instrument has its own set
of parameter controls which allow for the sound of each instrument to be
modified individually.

    sequence is the same as adding a drum hit to the sequence, select
    the accent as the instrument and select what nots you want to accent
    with the sequencer. The strength of the accented steps can be
    defined by using the the accent level control.
3.  **attack** - Alters the attack of the hit. Will change the strength
    of the hit. (bassdrum only)

    decay of the snare's tone.

sequencer is found. Once an instrument has been selected you can start
building up your drum sequence by adding instrument hits to the
sequencer by selecting the sequence buttons.

    using.
2.  **clear** - Will clear the currently selected pattern.
3.  **shuffle on/off** - Using the shuffle option will shuffle your

    either forward or backwards.
4.  **pattern length** - Displays the length of your sequence.
5.  **pattern +/-** - Allow for the length of your sequence to be

6.  **edit range** - The sequencer contains 16 step buttons but the
    Beatbox 9 allows for sequences up to 64 steps long. This control
    allows for you to use the same 16 buttons to edit a 64 step sequence
    by reusing the same step buttons to edit different parts of the
    sequence.
7.  **pattern selector** - Use these buttons to decide which pattern
    from your currently selected pattern bank you want to work on.
8.  **pattern bank** - Allows for toggling through the device's
    different pattern banks (A, B, C and D)

    buttons, each button has a corresponding position in the the

    want to work with and then selecting the buttons in the sequence
    where you want the hit to be played.
