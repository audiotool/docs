Software Keyboard
=================

If you do not have a midi-keyboard you can open a software-keyboard by
using the context-menu on a synthesiser.

You will now be able to play the synthesiser by either clicking on the keys with your mouse or 
by pressing the corresponding keys on your computer Keyboard.
