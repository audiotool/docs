When clicking this icon Audiotool will wait for you to play a note on your Midi Meyboard.
Once you have done so you can play the device with your Midi Keyboard.
If you have multiple Midi Keyboards you can easily assing different Keyboard to different synthesisers.
You can also connect one Midi Keyboard to multiple synthesisers.
Or try to use the :ref:`Notesplitter` to play multiple synthesisers with one Midi Keyboard.

If you want to use an external Midi Controller to control specific synthesiser parameters,
you can do so by right clicking on the desired knob inside the synthesiser and choose `Learn Midi Controller` from the context menu.
