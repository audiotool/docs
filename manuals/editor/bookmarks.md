#### Bookmarks - The Smarter Save As

With bookmarks, it is finally possible to jump back to older versions of
your tracks.

#### How are bookmarks different from save as?

Typically, "save as" implies that a new file is created and all
subsequent changes take place in that new file. We figured that this
will not go well with live collaboration:

  - Shall we create a new track on each 'save as'?
  - Will all collaborators automatically switch over to the new track?
  - When opening an older version, what will happen to the collaborators
    currently in the track?
  - What about publishing different versions of the same track...?

So, we came up with the bookmark idea.

  - When *creating* bookmarks, you and your collaborators can continue
    to work on the current track.
  - ''Opening a bookmark ''will create a new, unsaved track.
  - Working on the new track will not affect the original.
  - It can be saved and publish independently.
