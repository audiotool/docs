Live Collaboration
==================


Collaboration is an essential part of Audiotool. 
Once you saved your draft to the Audiotool cloud you can start inviting other users by clicking the invite button in the top right.

A pop up will open where you can search for other users to invite and manage their rights.
Users you are already connected with will be shown when they are online and available for collaboration.
