Centroid Extendable/Autonaming
==============================

The Centroid mixer can now shrink to 4 channels but can also be extended
to a 32 channel mixer. Use the context-menu to insert new or remove
unneeded channels. You can also focus the Centroid (e.g. click on it)
and use SHIFT+RIGHT to extend or SHIFT+LEFT to reduce the amount of
channels. A warning will appear if a channel is about to be removed that
is actually connected.

Channels without a custom name will now be named automatically. The
Centroid basically traces the input signal flow, tries to find the best
matching device and assigns its name to the channel. You can always
override it with your own naming.
