# Patreon

Patreon allows you to get paid by running a membership business
for your fans. The same way one can [pledge for
audiotool](https://www.audiotool.com/board/news/patreon), other patreon
users can pledge for your music. In a sense, Patreon is our financial
infrastructure.

about Patreon.

## How to get started?

*First*, create a Patreon account by visiting [this invitation
link](https://patreon.com/invite/yxdyzy) (use this link because we both
can then benefit from an additional reward).

*Secondly*,
[convert](https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002958403-How-do-I-become-a-creator-and-make-a-page-on-Patreon-)
it to a creator profile. You can still pledge for other users - that way
you can be a supporter and a creator at the same time\!

*Thirdly*, [connect your
Patreon](https://www.audiotool.com/user/preferences/connect) account to
your Audiotool account. We now can advertise your Patreon account on
your Audiotool profile.

*And lastly*, you can pledge for
[Audiotool](https://www.patreon.com/audiotool) too. Every dollar counts
to maintain and improve our service. Everybody wins\!
