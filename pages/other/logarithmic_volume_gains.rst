Difference to Flash
===================

In the Flash version all volume values were linear. This was a bad
decision in the first place and is now changed to logarithmic volume
mapping which acts more natural. When importing old flash tracks all
values will be converted and timeline automation will try to emulate the
new mapping. In some cases your flash tracks will sound slightly
different especially on busy volume/gain automations.
