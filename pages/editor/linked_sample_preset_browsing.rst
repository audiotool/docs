Linked Sample/Preset Browsing
=============================

If you want to search a sample within Audiotool's sample repository you
can link the device with the sample browser. Just use the context-menu
and select 'Browse sample' for instance on any slot of the Machiniste. A
orange color indicates the linked-state of the device. In this mode you
can preview the sample just by selecting it live in the device. This is
a fast way to test a bunch of samples within your current setup before
actually applying one. The same principle works for preset browsing.
