Live Collaboration
==================

This is probably the biggest enhancement in Next!

You can finally work on tracks with other users simultaneously. You can
see each others actions and talk via text-, audio- and videochat. All
changes are documented. We will introduce tools in time to bookmark
states to revert to or start a new track from there. The first beta
launch is all about live-collaborations and its performance. We need to
collect data to evaluate the server load hence being prepared for the
big public launch later this year.

Looking forward to your feedback!
