Timeline Bouncing
=================

You can now bounce parts of the timeline. Just set a range with the loop
marker and select **Project > Sample Upload > Bounce Timeline** in the
top bar menu. You can then adjust the parameters if needed and click
**Bounce**. After the mix-down is completed, Studio will automatically
open the sample editor Probe in a new browser-tab.

*Make sure you allow this by disabling any pop-up blocking.*

Two Pass Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode the audio renderer will loop the section twice to make sure
that all the delays and reverbs from the end of your range get wrapped
into the start. We highly recommend it for loops.

Probe
^^^^^

In **Probe**, cut your sample and/or apply effects. When you are done,
choose **File > Upload** and follow the instructions. **Probe** will
stay connected with Audiotool and you will receive a notification in
Studio when your sample is available.

Tempo
^^^^^

If the tempo is static, we will send the bpm to **Probe** as well and
immediately open the beat-grid feature to quickly cut your work in
beats.

**Enjoy!**
