Tone Matrix
===========

The tone matrix is a 16Ã—16 sequencing grid. The Tone Matrix has its own
internal sound but can also be used to sequence other devices. The Tone
Matrix has a fixed length of 1/4 of a bar and has a maximum of 7
different programmable internal patterns. The device's internal patterns
can be selected by toggling through the pattern bank just above the
grid, represented by 7 squares. The clear button allows for the selected
pattern to be deleted. The Tone Matrix can be utilised as a simple
sequencer by routing a cable from the note output into a device's note
input (where possible) If this is done the Tone Matrix can be used to
sequence the connected device but no sound will be coming from the Tone
Matrix itself.
