Helmholtz
=========

The Helmholtz is a device that resonates on five adjustable frequencies.
The industry term is 'comb filter'. It is accomplished by five short
tuneable delay-lines. The easiest way to understand the Helmholtz is to
input short noise-impulses (for instance from the Pulverisateur) and
fiddle with the parameters. It magically transforms the input into a
harmonic signal.
